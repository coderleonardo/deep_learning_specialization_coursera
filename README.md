# Deep Learning Specialization - Andrew Ng (Coursera)

There are 5 Courses in this Specialization.

## C01 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, we study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 

By the end, we became familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## C02 - Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
In the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization, we open the deep learning black box to understand the processes that drive performance and generate good results systematically. 

We learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications; be able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

## C03 - Structuring Machine Learning Projects
In the third course of the Deep Learning Specialization, we learn how to build a successful machine learning project and get to practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. 

By the end, we become able to diagnose errors in a machine learning system; prioritize strategies for reducing errors; understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance; and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

## C04 - Convolutional Neural Networks
In the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, we understand how computer vision has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more.

By the end, we become able to to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks; apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks; and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data. 

## C05 - Sequence Models
In the fifth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, we become familiar with sequence models and their exciting applications such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing (NLP), and more. 

By the end, we become able to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs; apply RNNs to Character-level Language Modeling; gain experience with natural language processing and Word Embeddings; and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to solve different NLP tasks such as NER and Question Answering.
