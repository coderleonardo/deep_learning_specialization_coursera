# Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application

By the time you complete this notebook, you will have finished the last programming assignment of Week 4, and also the last programming assignment of Course 1! Go you! 

To build your cat/not-a-cat classifier, you'll use the functions from the previous assignment to build a deep network. Hopefully, you'll see an improvement in accuracy over your previous logistic regression implementation.  

**After this assignment you will be able to:**

- Build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning

Let's get started!
